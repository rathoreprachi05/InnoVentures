	<h1>CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
	<p>Climate change is affecting our environment in different ways. Rising temperature is affecting our soil fertility and thus affecting our nutritional cycle. Climate change is seriously impacting on the world's water systems through flooding, droughts, as well as more extreme rainfall patterns creating further pressures on rivers and lakes that supply water for people and animals.
                    What is more, the world's oceans are also put at risk. Oceans are considered “carbon sinks” because they absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide, limiting its potential to contribute to further global warming.
